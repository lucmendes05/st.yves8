<hr>

<p>  
I think I might disappear, <br>
I’ll stop talking to people, <br>
They’ll think I lost my mind and <br>
Packed my things in a sack and waved goodbye, <br>
I’ll curl up in a ball - do nothing but cry <br>
Swim in the silence, learn to fly <br>
</p>

<p> 
Abandoned houses I called home, <br>
Left to wither and die, <br>
Betrayed like I betrayed their trust, <br>
Narrowed the canals through my teeth, <br>
Ground the faith to dust, <br>
Just add water. <br>
</p>
